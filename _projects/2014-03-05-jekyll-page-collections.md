title: Jekyll Page Collections
---

Jekyll Page Collections is a [Jekyll][jekyll] plugin to help create collections of pages
that behave just like posts.  You can fill a directory of files, each of which
represents a page.  The pages are processed just like posts are, and they can be
accessed through the `site.data` hash.  Each collection will be in the hash
using the name specified in the `_config.yml` file.
